The sensors measure the following properties: precipitation as Double with units 'L/m2', pressure as Double with units 'hPa', reducedPressure as Double with units 'hPa', solarRadiation as Double with units 'W/m2', relativeHumidity as Double with units '%', temperature15 as Double with units 'ºC', temperature11 as Double with units 'ºC', windDirection10m as Double with units 'º' windDirection2m as Double with units 'º', windSpeed10m as Double with units 'm/s', windSpeed2m as Double with units 'm/s'. It will be necessary to have two spatial aggregations: Province represented a polygon with the property name as String and Council represented a polygon with the property name as String. A Council is located inside a Province. The data will be retrieved every 500 seconds. The bounding box has a latitude of 42.7, a longitude of -8.1 and a zoom of 9.

The sensors measure the following properties: temperature_its90 as Double with units 'ºC' and icon 'thermometer-low', salinity as Double with units 'PSU', pressure as Double with units 'dbar' and icon 'speedometer', pH as Double with units 'ph' and icon 'ph', oxygen as double with units 'mg/l' and icon 'gas-cylinder', transmittance as Double with units 'm', irradiance as Double with units 'W/m2', density as Double with units 'kg/m3', and conductivity as Double with units 'S/m'. It will be necessary to aggregate by a spatial polygon dimension called Estuary and a categorical dimension called Depth. The spatial dimension Estuary will be a polygon with the follwing properties: shortName as String, name as String and zone as String. The categorical dimension Depth has the following ranges: surface from 0 to 3, 5m from 4.75 to 5.25, 10m from 9.75 to 10.25, 15m from 14.75 to 15.25, and 20m from 19.75 to 20.25.

The sensors measure the following properties: precipitation as Double with units 'L/m2', pressure as Double with units 'hPa', reducedPressure as Double with units 'hPa', solarRadiation as Double with units 'W/m2', relativeHumidity as Double with units '%', temperature15 as Double with units 'ºC', temperature11 as Double with units 'ºC', windDirection10m as Double with units 'º' windDirection2m as Double with units 'º', windSpeed10m as Double with units 'm/s', windSpeed2m as Double with units 'm/s'. It will be necessary to have two spatial aggregations: Province represented a polygon with the property name as String and Council represented a polygon with the property name as String. A Council is located inside a Province. The data will be retrieved every 500 seconds. The bounding box has a latitude of 42.7, a longitude of -8.1 and a zoom of 9.
